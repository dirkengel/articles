# articles

This repository lists my latest articles. Usually there are two files per article, the "source" ODT files and the the resulting PDF.

- FTE based Planning: Issues of planning software projects based on FTEs. 
- The Ozone Hole Metric: All at one glance, a composite metric to track the development progress of SW components.
